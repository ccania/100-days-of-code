# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I cloned Kallaway's 100 Days of Code repo and will be logging my progress here for the next 100\(!\) days. I worked on expanding my simple map to take an address that is passed via an input field. I have not been able to update the address variable with JavaScript so that it works.   

**Thoughts:** I need to gain more practice in using JavaScript to store information from field elements and calling functions through click events.

### Day 2: May 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I worked out a solution in JavaScript to take the value of an input field and print it to an element. I know this is an incredibly basic cornerstone in JavaScript, but it was tripping me up in expanding my [current map project](https://github.com/ccania/map-places.git). Now that I have it figured out, I should be able to use the same logic to allow a user to enter a location into a field for my Google map, and have the map render the location based on a given location. And guess what? IT WORKED! :clap: I ended up calling initMap() from a submit button that passed the value of an input field into a variable that points the map at the given location.   

**Thoughts:** Sometimes you have to take a step back and concentrate on the basics in order to get to the next level of more sophisticated coding.

### Day 3: May 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I am working on solving the third practice item in the second chapter of Haverbeke's [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html). I am working on loops within loops, and how to output a specific variable based on if the character position is odd or even. I think I'm close to the solution, but I am struggling to put it all together.

**Thoughts:** If it takes an average of 10,000 hours for mastery, at this rate of an hour a day, I will have something to look forward to on September 18, 2044.
