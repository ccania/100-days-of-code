# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 1, 2017 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: I cloned Kallaway's 100 Days of Code repo and will be logging my progress here for the next 90\(!\) days. I worked on expanding my simple map to take an address that is passed via an input field. I have not been able to update the address variable with JavaScript so that it works.   

**Thoughts:** I need to gain more practice in using JavaScript to store information from field elements and calling functions through click events.
